# Introduction to Motion Planning and Locomotion

Motion planning and locomotion are fundamental capabilities for mobile robots, particularly humanoid robots that must navigate complex environments. Motion planning involves determining a sequence of movements to achieve a goal while avoiding obstacles, while locomotion encompasses the mechanisms and control strategies that enable movement. This chapter explores the algorithms, techniques, and control strategies used in robotic motion planning and locomotion.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of motion planning and locomotion
- Identify different types of motion planning algorithms
- Recognize the challenges in humanoid locomotion
- Apply basic motion planning techniques to simple scenarios
- Evaluate the trade-offs between different locomotion strategies
