# Introduction to Sensors and Actuators

Sensors and actuators form the fundamental interface between a robot and its environment. Sensors allow robots to perceive their surroundings and internal state, while actuators enable them to interact with and manipulate the physical world. This chapter explores the various types of sensors and actuators used in robotics, with a focus on their application in humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Identify the major types of sensors used in robotics
- Understand the principles of operation for different actuators
- Recognize the challenges in sensor integration and actuator control
- Evaluate the trade-offs between different sensor and actuator technologies
- Apply sensor and actuator selection principles to specific robotic applications
